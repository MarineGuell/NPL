"The science of networks has revolutionised research into the dynamics of interacting elements. It could be argued that epidemiology in particular has embraced the potential of network theory more than any other discipline.

"We present a brief review of brane-world models - models in which our observable Universe with its standard matter fields is assumed as localized on a domain wall (three-brane) in a higher dimensional surrounding (bulk) spacetime. Models of this type arise naturally in M-theory and have been intensively studied during the last years. We pay particular attention to the covariant projection approach, the Cardassian scenario, to induced gravity models, self-tuning models and the Ekpyrotic scenario.",astronomy
"In biology, a biological life cycle (or just life cycle when the biological context is clear) is a series of stages of the life of an organism, that begins as a zygote, often in an egg, and concludes as an adult that reproduces, producing an offspring in the form of a new zygote which then itself goes through the same series of stages, the process repeating in a cyclic fashion.

That early settlement, important in the spread of the Neolithic Revolution from the Near East to Europe, lasted for almost a millennium before being inundated by rising water levels. The first human settlement on the Asian side, the Fikirtepe mound, is from the Copper Age period, with artifacts dating from 5500 to 3500 BCE.

"We suggest that Davidov's solitons, propagating through the backbone of a protein, can mediate conformational transition and folding of a protein to its native state.

The interaction provides the conformation field with the energy needed in order to overcome energy barriers for folding, thus avoiding the need for stochastic therm",biology

To explore the portion of cellular metabolism equipped with multiple pathways, we categorize individual metabolic reactions and compounds as viable or inviable: A compound is viable if processed by two or more reactions, and a reaction is viable if all of its substrates and products are viable. Using this classification, we identify the maximal subnetwork of viable nodes,",microbiology

Leptogenesis is at the heart of particle cosmology which requires physics beyond the Standard Model. There are two possibilities of realizing leptogenesis; thermal and non-thermal. Both are viable given the scale of inflation and the constraint on the reheat temperature. However non-thermal leptogenesis can leave its imprint upon cosmic micro wave background radiation. In this paper we will discuss cosmological constraints on non-thermal leptogenesis scenarios within supersymmetry.,astronomy
